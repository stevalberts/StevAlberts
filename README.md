### Pleased to see you today!

Ever wondered how data can be harnessed to revolutionize industries? As a versatile software developer and data engineer, I turn that curiosity into reality by creating innovative technology solutions that drive impactful change. My expertise lies in developing data management systems, business intelligence tools, and transaction systems, all aimed at boosting efficiency and providing data-driven insights. I specialize in data engineering tasks such as acquiring, integrating, and validating datasets, and applying statistical techniques using Python and SQL to solve real-world problems. Proficient in tools like Tableau, Looker, and PowerBI, I also bring experience in technical documentation, cloud technologies (Firebase, GCP, AWS), UI/UX design, and mobile development (iOS, Android using Objective-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin, Flutter, Angular). Explore my GitHub repositories to see my work and let's collaborate on your next groundbreaking project.
